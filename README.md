According to the CDC, heart disease is one of the leading causes of death both in the United States and globally [1, 2]. Detecting and preventing the factors that have the greatest impact on heart disease is very important in healthcare. Computational developments, in turn, allow the application of machine learning methods to detect "patterns" from the data that can predict a patient's condition. Thus, our diagnostic support tool has the potential to bolster population health management, financial success, and better outcomes across the value-based care continuum primarily targeting individuals at risk of heart disease.
